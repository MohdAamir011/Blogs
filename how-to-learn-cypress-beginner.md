# Getting Started with Cypress for End-to-End Testing

Cypress is a powerful end-to-end testing framework for modern web applications. It allows you to write and execute tests that simulate user interactions within your web application. In this blog post, we'll walk you through the basics of getting started with Cypress.

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
- A web application you want to test

## Installation

To get started with Cypress, you need to install it as a dev dependency in your project. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

npm install cypress --save-dev
